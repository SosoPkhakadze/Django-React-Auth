changing password functions already implemented. only thing you need to add is in the settings.py
and add EMAIL_HOST_USER = {your email} and EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = {your gmail app password} if you don't have it 
you have to create it first and then add here. then you first run the backend, then you run frontend and you 
start adding anything you like to this project.
